				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editors Note: This post is part of a &#8220;Guest&#8221; series entitled Enterprise Architecture with Force.com. Our <em>guest blogger, </em>Greg Cook, is a managing partner of CloudPremise and currently holds all seven Salesforce certifications.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-91241" alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1417024646/greg_cook_b38c2h.jpg" width="81" height="120" />What are the components of a good Salesforce Integration Architecture? As a Salesforce Architect it is your role to lead your company in the evolution of it’s Integration Architecture. A good architect must understand both integration architecture and integration patterns. The difference between the two is analogous to designing the highway versus driving cars on the highway. The Salesforce1 Platform offers architects and developers a wide array of integration technologies and recommended patterns (the cars). However, without the correct Integration Architecture and technology infrastructure (the highway) your projects and solutions will be at risk for performance, scalability, data integrity, and many other problems. This post shares patterns gathered from my experience in creating an effective Integration Architecture for clients, and shares a reference design drawn from many of these. You should also consult the official <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/integration_patterns/integration_patterns_and_practices.pdf">Salesforce Integration Patterns guide</a> when architecting your Salesforce solutions.</p>
<h2>The Integration Architecture Aligns the Business Strategy with Technical Capabilities</h2>
<p>The best Salesforce Architectures are not based upon incumbent technology, singular architecture approaches, or corporate politics. The best Salesforce Architectures are based upon delivering business value. What this means for the architect is to focus on what are the business’s requirements, roadmap, and needs for which you will offer technical capabilities. In other words – you need to see where the business wants to drive, and figure out which highways and roads are necessary to support the amount of traffic. Idealistic architecture (for example, 100% Services Oriented Architecture) may cripple your ability to provide the capabilities needed by your business when they need them.</p>
<h2>The Integration Architecture supports a Mix of Batch Processing and Real-time Services Middleware</h2>
<p>Good Salesforce architects have learned that the best integration designs support both batch and service-based patterns.  This means having multiple types of middleware at work.  I have had clients with three to four different integration platforms in their Salesforce architectural landscape.  This is because no single solution can effectively meet all of your requirements, and once again the idealistic architectures are not as important as supporting the business&#8217;s needs.</p>
<h2>The Integration Architecture is Based Upon Business Service Level Agreements (SLAs)</h2>
<p>A mature organization and architect will attempt to define SLAs for data and process integrations. These SLAs have an important role on projects as they may radically affect the chosen technology and integration pattern. The SLAs should be based upon real business needs (sorry – not everything in life needs to be real time) that help define the non-functional requirements. If you only need to drive a few miles you do not need a highway. However if you are going on a road-trip I hope you aren’t taking side-roads! Define your solutions based upon your business’s service-level requirements.</p>
<p>One important aspect of managing SLA’s on the Salesforce1 platform is to understand if and when to use asynchronous processing. The multi-tenant design of Salesforce makes it impractical to use asynch patterns when conforming to SLAs. A batch or @future job may not finish processing as quickly as needed, and there is very little you can do about that (apart from adjusting the SLAs). But as CCE Principal Architect Bud Vieira points out, &#8220;This may depend on whether your SLAs are determined simply by response times of individual queries, inserts, deletes and updates (as in a transactional process), or throughput of an overall operation. For example, time to complete a stock buy versus how quickly a sales account realignment process can be completed.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The Integration Architecture Has a Clearly Defined Standard for Applying Different Integration Use Cases</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As your landscape evolves and your Salesforce expertise matures, the goal is to define a set of capabilities and standards for all Salesforce integrations at your company.  Each project should not have to define when and where to use what technologies, how and when to authenticate, etc.  These architecturally significant designs should be standardized for your enterprise.  This is where a Center of Excellence or Architecture Review Board comes into play.  Each Salesforce project should be subservient to a higher level integration architecture authority that is typically governed outside of the Salesforce1 platform teams.</p>
<h2>A Typical Enteprise Salesforce Integration Architecture</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at a reference Salesforce Integration Architecture.  This may or may not look like your existing landscape &#8211; however this reference is based upon years of work at many Fortune 500 companies.  The reference design also does not recommend one technology vendor or solution over another &#8211; rather the goal is to understand the technical capabilities that you can (and probably should) consider as your Salesforce Platform landscape matures.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-91211" title="Force.com Enterprise Architecture" alt="Force.com Enterprise Architecture Greg Cook" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_517/v1417024231/reference-integration-architecture_frhefm.png" width="517" height="388" /></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the most common integration use-cases and how they apply to your Salesforce Integration Architecture.  The direction of the arrows in the reference model is not necessarily the way the data is moving, but rather the way the integration connection is being established.  This is a critical aspect of Integration Architecture as it pertains to your security and any real-time requirements.</p>
<h2>Cloud-to-Ground (Salesforce Platform Originated)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In Cloud-to-Ground use cases you are attempting to push a transaction (message or data) from Salesforce into your On-Premise infrastructure.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #1</strong> &#8211; The Salesforce originated message is relayed to a DMZ (demilitarized zone) service end-point.  This could be a firewall, a services gateway appliance, or reverse proxy.  You must work closely with your security team to define this layer as opening the corporate firewall to inbound web traffic is a high security risk.  This is where much (if not all) of your security authentication from Salesforce Platform occurs.  Whitelisted IPs, two-way SSL, and basic HTTP authentication are some of the ways to authenticate Salesforce into the DMZ layer.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #2 </strong>- The message is relayed from the DMZ security zone into the trusted On-Premise infrastructure.  The message is usually destined for an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) and durable message queue.  The ESB also would handle any transformation, mediation, and orchestration services required by the detailed integration requirements.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #3</strong> &#8211; Depending on your Enterprise Architecture the ESB maybe pushing the message into the SOA infrastructure.  These web-services are providing consumer agnostic data and business process services to the Enterprise.  The Salesforce Platform can become a consumer (and later a producer) of these SOA services.  By reusing existing SOA web-services you can save your project a lot of time and money as opposed to integrating directly into the source system.  If you do not have a SOA layer your project may be responsible for integrating directly into the legacy application.</p>
<p><strong>Capability #4</strong> &#8211; Another key capability for mature Salesforce Integration Architectures is for some sort of On-Premise database access.  This maybe a standalone database or part of a more formal Enterprise Data Warehouse (including an ODS – an operational data store).  Most commonly (but not always) in a Cloud-to-Ground scenario this transaction would be a database READ.  The Salesforce Platform can read data from the database in real (or near-real) time.</p>
<h2>Ground-to-Cloud (On-Premise Originated)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In Ground-to-Cloud use cases you are attempting to push AND pull data from Salesforce from your On-Premise infrastructure.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #5</strong> &#8211; A mature Integration Architecture should be handling all of the real-time calls into Salesforce from the ESB.  However if you do NOT have an ESB, this step would occur from each separate application requiring access to Salesforce.  From a security standpoint it is much better to handle all of the calls to Salesforce from a centralized integration middleware.  You can use oAuth or user/pw session based authentication to Salesforce.  The middleware may already have a session with Salesforce so that you would not need to authenticate again for every transaction.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #6</strong> &#8211; Many integrations can be accomplished in a batch design.  This is often the cheapest and fastest way to get data in and out of the Salesforce Platform.  I would recommend a robust ETL solution for all Salesforce environments.  The role of the ETL is to move large data volumes using the Bulk API where possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #7</strong> &#8211; As a Salesforce architect you have a responsibility to your company or client to off-load your Salesforce data into a replicated copy.  My argument for this is that while Salesforce’s database is not likely to have outages or lose data, you and your team are VERY likely to break your own data via user error, bad-code, or run-away processes.  By replicating your data off-line you now have the power to restore data to an earlier state without engaging Salesforce (who may or may not be able to restore it exactly as necessary). A key architecture choice here, although it may seem trivial, is to make sure these kinds of replications are processing diffs, and never whole tables whether records have changed or not. It&#8217;s a scalability killer, and so needs to be thought out up front.</p>
<p><strong>Capability #8</strong> &#8211; The ETL is also responsible for moving data in and out of your database infrastructure.  Often data is necessary to be staged into Salesforce (Accounts for example) from the EDW.  Also pulling data down from Salesforce into your EDW may be much easier when done using batch processing patterns.</p>
<h2>Cloud-to-Cloud</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #9</strong> &#8211; If you have multiple orgs (<a title="Force.com Enterprise Architecture: Single-org versus Multi-org Strategy" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2014/10/enterprise-architecture-multi-org-strategy.html">Single-org versus Multi-org Strategy</a>) you will often have the need to integrate between the Orgs.  Salesforce makes this (sometimes too) easy via Salesforce2Salesforce.  You can also directly contact another Org via RESTful web services integration.  The Salesforce Platform’s road-map includes the ability to consume other org’s data via <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=cod_overview.htm">Hub/Spoke</a> which may also be a good way of providing read-only access across your org landscape.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #10</strong> &#8211; The Salesforce Platform’s robust integration technology makes it very easy to integrate point-to-point with other systems.  While it would be recommended for some solutions (Google Maps mashups, etc) I would try to stay away from using Apex as your primary integration technology.  While it is more than capable at handling transformation, error handling, and retries &#8211; these types of requirements should be pushed to middleware if possible. The more that Salesforce is made to be the hub of integration activity, the more time you will spend building, maintaining, and troubleshooting integrations as opposed to building new business value.  This is a trap I have seen many companies fall into.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #11</strong> &#8211; Rather than using the Salesforce Platform to be your hub of cloud-to-cloud integration activity many companies have moved towards Cloud based Integration-as-a-Service packages.  While not true ESB’s per se, many integration vendors have started providing cloud based solutions for managing your cloud-to-cloud use cases.   Because these solutions are specifically tailored for the Salesforce Platform (and other popular SaaS vendors), the time to build and deploy an integration can be radically reduced as opposed to using the On-Premise ESB.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Capability #12</strong> &#8211; The cloud service bus can handle service mediation, transformation, routing, error handling, etc to your other cloud based end-points.  Having to build durable and resilient integration solutions inside of Salesforce can be expensive and very complicated.  Middleware should be used where and when possible.</p>
<p><strong>Capability #13</strong> &#8211; Some companies prefer to broker all integrations through their ESB, including Cloud-to-Cloud use cases.  My warnings here are this: the cost of highly resilient ESB’s can be EXTREMELY high.  If the service levels between Salesforce and Workday, for example, must go through your on-premise technology, you maybe shooting yourself in the foot.  Now your “Cloud” solution is piggy-backing on the same technical infrastructure, cost, service levels, and release timeline of your On-Premise solutions.  Tread lightly and make sure to design your Integration Architecture first and foremost about delivering BUSINESS VALUE.</p>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>I was previously an Enterprise Architect working with Service Oriented Architectures before becoming a Salesforce Certified Technical Architect.  When I was first introduced to Salesforce I was surprised to see either a 100% dependency on batch integration technology or a total reluctance to use anything but Real-Time services design.  However one of the reasons I enjoy what I do so much is that I have learned that there is no glass slipper in Salesforce Integration Architecture.  One size does not fit all and no one solution can be the best for all or your requirements.  It is up to you as the architect to analyze, recommend, and implement a variety of integration capabilities that will enable your team, clients, and company to realize the powerful transformation of moving to the Salesforce1 Platform.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Team CYC Trailblazers</em></p>
<p>What happens if you put 60 young people of color in a school all weekend? Will they trash the joint? Add graffiti to the walls? Or, will they design and prototype an app that keeps graffiti OFF the walls in their communities?</p>
<p>November 14-16, 2014, I had the honor of mentoring a team of young men and women as part of the <a title="mbkhack" href="http://www.mbkhack.com/" target="_blank">My Brother&#8217;s Keeper Hackathon Weekend</a> (<a title="hack" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mbkhack&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#MBKHack</a>), organized by <a title="ywc" href="http://www.yeswecode.org/" target="_blank">#YesWeCode</a> and <a title="qeyno" href="http://www.qeyno.com/" target="_blank">Qeyno Labs</a>. If you want to just skip to the goodness, check out <a title="FB" href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.921351061208306.1073741853.285602154783203&amp;type=1" target="_blank">this Facebook photo album</a>.</p>
<p>Salesforce participated in the previous Qeyno Labs hackathons: <a title="swo" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2014/02/startup-weekend-oakland-black-male-achievement-recap.html" target="_blank">Startup Weekend Oakland: Black Male Achievement</a> and #YesWeCodeHack at EssenceFest (recapped in <a title="DF14" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8-Xa-i6H1w&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">this Dreamforce 2014 session</a>), but this was my first time on the ground as a mentor. I was joined by two familiar faces: <a title="jayvi" href="https://twitter.com/JayvinArora" target="_blank">Jayvin Arora</a>, leader of the <a title="SFDC" href="http://www.meetup.com/Salesforce-Philly/" target="_blank">Salesforce.com Philadelphia User Group</a> and newly minted Salesforce MVP, and <a title="jose" href="https://twitter.com/JArechavalaII" target="_blank">Jose Arechavala</a>, graduate of the <a title="hopeworks" href="http://www.hopeworks.org/" target="_blank">Hopeworks</a> Salesforce Developer training program in Camden, NJ. Arora taught HTML and CSS to the Trailblazers on the winning team, CYC, and Arechavala was on my team and coded for hours on end to build the Recupery app, which won the &#8220;Most Social Impact&#8221; award.</p>
<h1>Life-Changing Weekend</h1>
<p>We were promised a life-changing weekend, and the hackathon delivered. One part inspiration and one part perspiration, the event challenged the teenagers (referred to as &#8220;Trailblazers&#8221; &#8211; an intentionally empowering term) and their mentors to design, prototype, and define a business plan for a social good application, in less than 48 hours.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-91101" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_500/v1417020700/IdeaPitches_s7nus2.jpg" width="500" height="281" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Trailblazers lined up to deliver their idea pitches</em></p>
<p>The Trailblazers arrived ready. One at a time, they took the stage to deliver one-minute pitches for their app ideas. A total of 40 ideas were pitched, and then everyone voted. My favorite idea was an app that turned your mobile phone in to a smoke detector, to reduce the deaths from fires in an apartment or home that either doesn&#8217;t have a smoke detector or has one that is out of batteries. This idea did not make it to the final stages, but I thought it was brilliant. It was this kind of thinking &#8211; thinking that comes from really living with a problem, not just reading about it &#8211; that made all of the app ideas so innovative.</p>
<p>Teams formed around the top 10 ideas, with both Trailblazers and mentors gravitating to the idea that spoke to them the most. I liked this organizational aspect (rather than being assigned to a team). It resulted in teams of various sizes, but meant that all team members were invested in the final product. And, in the case of our team, everyone had a personal connection to the problem we were trying to solve: restoring brain health when a teenager is feeling &#8220;not in their right mind&#8221; &#8211; this covered a wide range of mental health challenges, including depression and gang recruitment pressure. That made the functional design challenging, but at the end of the day, the goal was to connect the student with a counselor who could help.</p>
<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>The long hours of perspiration were injected with inspiration, both from the mentors sharing their personal stories, and from <a title="kalimah" href="https://twitter.com/priforce" target="_blank">Kalimah Priforce</a> and <a title="van" href="https://twitter.com/VanJones68" target="_blank">Van Jones</a> waking us up on Sunday morning with a history lesson and a call to action.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-91031" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_500/v1417018342/kalimah_kmhypw.jpg" width="500" height="333" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Kalimah Priforce</em></p>
<p>Priforce spoke to the importance of inclusion, and how even though this hackathon is in support of the White House&#8217;s <a title="mbk" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/my-brothers-keeper" target="_blank">My Brothers Keeper</a> initiative (which addresses persistent opportunity gaps faced by boys and young men of color and ensure that all young people can reach their full potential), he invited girls and trans youth to participate, because we all need to work together to solve the problems in our communities. He also spoke about the historical importance of literacy, calling programming the &#8220;literacy of the 21st century.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jones continued the history lesson, and I think it&#8217;s very likely that his talk was the first time the Trailblazers had heard about the lunch counter sit in in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone thinks Martin Luther King, Jr. gave a speech and that was the end of it&#8230;that&#8217;s not how it was,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;Those four students, young people, people who wanted to change the way things had been for 100 years, they sat down and ordered coffee &#8211; now, you&#8217;re thinking &#8216;I go to Starbucks and order coffee all the time&#8217; &#8211; well back then, it wasn&#8217;t allowed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Van Jones</em></p>
<p>The call to action was a call for a radical change in the opportunities that young Black and Latino men and women see as viable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The media tells you you can be a basketball player, a rapper, or on the corner&#8230;&#8217;doing math&#8217;&#8230;what if there was another option? What if technology was a viable path?&#8221; &#8211; Van Jones</p></blockquote>
<p>This one weekend opened new possibilities for these Trailblazers, and will have a ripple effect in their families, friends, and community.</p>
<h1>Winning Ideas</h1>
<p>The final pitches were delivered by the Trailblazers and were incredibly professional and deeply passionate. The winning app ideas were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Change Your Community (CYC)</strong> &#8211; An app that allows community members to take pictures of abandoned buildings in their neighborhood and use the app to connect real estate developers, designers and government agencies to partner in renovating the buildings in a manner that will benefit the community.</li>
<li><strong>Game School</strong> &#8211; Sports app that allows gamers to not only play games but to also see the coding behind the scenes and provide tutorials to assist with learning coding.</li>
<li><strong>Kiduply</strong> &#8211; An Uber-like Carpool app for kids and parents in extracurricular activities. The app will connect parents with kids attending similar activities and coordinate car pooling.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-90761" title="Sara Morgan - Nothing But .Net" alt="Connecting to Force.com from Visual Studio" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416947173/SaraMorgan_120x120_danqvk.jpg" width="119" height="120" />This will be the last in the Nothing but .NET series, and I have saved the best for last. Throughout this series I have focused on various aspects of the new <a title="Force.com Toolkit for .Net" href="https://github.com/developerforce/Force.com-Toolkit-for-NET">Force.com Toolkit for .NET</a>. Last month at <a title="Developers @ Dreamforce 2014" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/dreamforce">Dreamforce 2014</a>, salesforce.com and Microsoft quietly introduced the new Connected Service Provider for Salesforce. It utilizes the open source Force.com Toolkit, but delivers it in a way that helps make .NET developers super productive.</p>
<p>Connected Services, which was first introduced by Microsoft in Visual Studio 2013, is a Visual Studio Extension that offers you access to various service providers through the Visual Studio Extension Gallery. The Salesforce Provider installs the Force.com Toolkit for .NET, which already makes it easier to access Salesforce through the REST API. Additionally, it configures scaffolding code and code models that help get your connected services project up and running as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>I had an opportunity to assess a technical preview version of the Salesforce Connected Service Provider. In this last post, I will tell you about some of the exciting things you can expect with this new provider, which was recently made publically available with the Visual Studio 2015 Preview.</p>
<h2>Configuring the Connected Service App</h2>
<p>You can get started with the Salesforce Connected Services Provider by downloading and installing the <a title="VisualStudio Preview" href="http://www.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio 2015 Preview</a>. From there, you can access Connected Services by creating a new ASP.NET Web Application using the MVC template or a Console app for those automated batch jobs you may be building. You will need to download and install the Salesforce Provider from the Visual Studio Gallery and once you do, a restart of Visual Studio is required.</p>
<p>To add a Connected Service to your new project, you simply right-click the references folder and select Add Connected Service. It should be located right under Service Reference. Currently, working with the Force.com Toolkit for .NET involves setting up a Connected App in your Salesforce org. One of the nice things about working with the Salesforce Connected Service Provider is that it handles all this for you.</p>
<p>As you go through the wizard to configure the provider, it first prompts you to select a Salesforce environment that you will use during development (see Figure 1). You will be asked to authenticate to that environment using your credentials and either allow or deny access to the client application you are creating. Keep in mind that credentials you enter here will only be used for configuration and will not be the credentials used to authenticate against the REST endpoint at runtime.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-90571" title="Configure Salesforce for .Net" alt="Nothing But .Net - Configure Salesforce for .Net" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_521/v1416510061/figure1_bqhogu.png" width="521" height="358" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 1</strong> - Salesforce Provider Environment Selection allows you to select the Salesforce org your app will connect to during development.</em></p>
<p>By clicking allow, you are granting the connected service permission to access your basic information, access and manage your data and perform requests on your behalf. What it actually does is create a new connected app with the same name as your Visual Studio project and set the callback URL and oAuth scope settings for you. All you have to do is return to the connected app definition, click to reveal the secret and copy this secret value into your web.config to complete the configuration process. Sweet!</p>
<p>The next step is to select a runtime authentication model. As I mentioned in the <a title=" Querying Objects with the new Force.com Toolkit for .NET" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2014/10/nothing-but-dotnet-querying-objects-new-force-com-toolkit-net.html">fourth article of this series</a>, the .NET Toolkit currently supports two oAuth 2.0 authentication flows: Web-Server and Username-Password. These correspond with the first and third options available in this step (see Figure 2). The second option, “Service account using a digital certificate” involves using a JWT bearer token and should only be used when your users do not have a Salesforce account. For most web applications, you will want to select the first option which utilizes the web-server oAuth authentication flow. The product team didn’t get a chance to complete the JWT Bearer Token flow for preview, but left the option in to get feedback if it’s a desired option.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-90651" title="Configuring Force.com authentication" alt="the configuration process involves selecting a method that your users will use to authenticate to Salesforce." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_510/v1416868294/Figure2_kbiqe6.png" width="510" height="352" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 2</strong> &#8211; Step 2 of the configuration process involves selecting a method that your users will use to authenticate to Salesforce.</em></p>
<h2>Benefits of Strongly-Typed Models</h2>
<p>If you have been following the Nothing but .NET series, then you know that you can use strongly-typed or dynamically typed objects when performing operations against Salesforce objects using the Force.com Toolkit for .NET. Obviously, working with strongly-typed objects has the advantages of access to intellisense and the ability to detect typo errors at compile time rather than at runtime.</p>
<p>When you configure the Salesforce Provider, you are given the option to generate models for all objects or just particular ones that you select (see Figure 3). If you select this option, then the Provider will create class file definitions for each of the selected objects in your Salesforce org. If you are creating an MVC app, then you can easily use these model files to automatically generate code for your views. This can be a real time saver when it comes to developing your application.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-90621" title="Nothing But .Net - Configuring Salesforce for .Net" alt="Configuring Salesforce for .Net" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,h_354/v1416864411/Figure3_tijokb.png" width="512" height="354" /></p>
<p><em><strong>Figure 3</strong> &#8211; You can optionally generate models for all or selected Salesforce objects, which allows you to use scaffold templates to automatically build out views in MVC applications.</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you opt to scaffold all objects, the final configuration will take longer to execute. After all, most orgs come with over 200 objects and it takes a while to create all those model files. Once the installation is complete, you should be directed to a web page that lets you access the documentation.</p>
<h2>What was Installed?</h2>
<p>The installation will add the <strong>DeveloperForce.Force</strong> NuGet package to your project, along with a few other .NET references you will need. It will also add a couple of configured class files (SalesforceService.cs and SalesforceOAuthRedirectHandler.cs) that will be located in the Service References/Salesforce subfolder.</p>
<p>This is where you will find the code to instantiate the <strong>AuthenticationClient</strong> and authenticate the user using the <strong>WebServerAsync</strong> method (if you picked the Web Server flow as I suggested). It also provides a way for you to store the Access Token, Instance URL and Refresh Token in Session variables, so they can be used later to create the ForceClient.</p>
<p>The best part is that it has already setup your connected app in Salesforce. That’s right. Check it out by logging into your Salesforce instance and going to <strong>Setup | Create | Apps</strong>. There will be a new connected app named whatever you named your Visual Studio project. All you need to do it click the <strong>Click to Reveal</strong> link to get the consumer secret. You will need to copy this value into your web.config, which already has the settings needed to authenticate.</p>
<p>There are a few other steps needed to get completely setup, but they are very straight forward and the documentation provided does a great job of explaining them in the Next Steps section.</p>
<h2>Customizing the Scaffolding Code</h2>
<p>One of my favorite things about the Salesforce Provider is the use of T4 templates for scaffolding code. This means that you can customize the code that is scaffolded into your project. The Salesforce Provider comes with three T4 templates, but you have the option of installing a T4 Editor and editing the existing templates or creating entirely new ones.</p>
<p>This means you have full control over the code that is generated for your projects. If your development team adheres to certain coding standards or styles, you can have these applied directly to the code that is scaffolded for each project.</p>
<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>The new Connected Service Provider uses the currently available open source Force.com Toolkit for .NET. If you are doing active development with the Salesforce REST services and especially if you are even considering using the Force.com Toolkit, then I strongly suggest you check out Connected Services.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning too. The Connected Services Salesforce Provider is already good, but it will just get better since the underlying technology used to connect to Salesforce is open source. Additionally, Connected Services appears to be the new way to access SaaS endpoints. When you configure your connected service, you will notice that it includes providers for connecting to Azure Mobile Services, Azure Storage and Office 365 API’s. I would not be surprised to see other SaaS providers added to the list in time. So, what are you waiting for? Download and install it today!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2014/11/salesforce1-mobile-app-version-7-0.html"><img align="right" hspace="5" width="150" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416430593/S1_xxk3lh.jpg" class="alignright wp-post-image tfe" alt="" title="" /></a>Version 7.0 of the Salesforce1 Mobile App was recently released, featuring new functionality, better performance and usability improvements. This blog post focuses on the developer impact of Salesforce1 7.0.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em"><img class="alignleft wp-image-90101" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416430593/S1_xxk3lh.jpg" width="175" height="175" />If you have your iPhone or iPad set to auto-update its apps, you might have already noticed that there&#8217;s a new release of the <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/mobile">Salesforce1 Mobile App</a>: Version 7.0. (If you don&#8217;t have your iOS device set to auto-update apps, go update Salesforce1 manually, right now!)</span></p>
<p>For Android users, Salesforce1 7.0 will be coming to you in the next week or two (safe harbor), or, if you can&#8217;t wait, <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewSolution?urlname=Android-v7-0-release-notification&amp;language=en_US">try out the beta</a>.</p>
<p>This new release adds a number of sales and productivity features, such as Lead Conversion and a detailed Events view, but in this blog post I&#8217;ll focus on the changes most relevant to developers. For the full list, see <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/salesforce1/id404249815?mt=8">Salesforce 1 in iTunes</a> or the Google Play store (when it arrives there), or watch the <a href="http://salesforce.vidyard.com/watch/XKRw0LWqOdj9RDUychCNNQ">release readiness video</a>.</p>
<h2 style="clear: both">Performance!</h2>
<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you open the new version of the app is that it is MUCH faster and slicker. I don&#8217;t have a quantitative measure of the improvement, but it certainly feels to me like a significant improvement on the last version. Great job by the S1 Mobile team!</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<h3>Action Bar</h3>
<p>The next thing you&#8217;ll notice is the new <strong>Action Bar</strong> across the bottom of the screen, in place of the Publisher (&#8216;+&#8217;) icon.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="wp-image-90111 aligncenter" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_320/v1416431199/Feed_rxglww.png" width="320" height="568" /><br />
Now the most commonly used actions are immediately available, and more actions are visible when showing the list, reducing the number of taps required to get where you&#8217;re going.</p>
<div style="clear: both">
<p><img class="wp-image-90121 aligncenter" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_320/v1416431236/ActionList_xixxzq.png" width="320" height="568" /></p>
</div>
<h3 style="clear: both">Record Navigation</h3>
<p>Gone are the cryptic &#8216;dots&#8217; on the record page representing the feed, details and related list panes; in their place: intuitive, descriptive labels.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="wp-image-90131 aligncenter" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_320/v1416431282/Record_svpso7.png" width="320" height="568" /></p>
<h3 style="clear: both">Row-Level Actions</h3>
<p>Another time-saver &#8211; swipe left on any record in a related list to get to its actions.</p>
<div style="width: 720px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"><img class="alignleft wp-image-90141" style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_320/v1416431925/RelatedList_bwi7ct.png" width="320" height="568" /><img class="alignleft wp-image-90151" style="margin-left: 20px;margin-right: 20px" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_320/v1416431943/RelatedListActions_keklrc.png" width="320" height="568" /></div>
<p style="clear: both">The great thing about all of the above UI changes: your existing customizations will work just fine. Any custom actions defined on an object will now appear as row-level actions as well as on the record page.</p>
<h2>Dashboards</h2>
<p>More on the admin side, but it&#8217;s worth mentioning the slew of improvements in Dashboards on Salesforce1. You can now tap into a Dashboard and interact with your data, drill into the underlying report, see your 5 most recently used Dashboards while offline, and share Dashboards to the Chatter feed, right from the Salesforce1 Mobile App.</p>
<div style="width: 780px;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto"><img class="alignleft wp-image-90161" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416434773/InteractiveDashboards_fpyjzn.png" width="236" height="422" /><img class="alignleft wp-image-90411" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416435261/OfflineDashboards_fucbvd.png" width="236" height="422" /><img class="alignleft wp-image-90421" style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right: 10px" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416435086/SharingDashboards_poq8nj.png" width="236" height="422" /></div>

<h3>Meeting Ever Exceeding Mobile Expectations</h3>
<p dir="ltr"> Building a mobile app? Get ready for an escalating list of requirements!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Full Offline Support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Focused User Interface</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Infinite Scrolling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Cross-Platform Deployments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="ltr">Branding</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Enterprise mobile apps are now expected to solve some of the most complicated use cases. To help developers with those requirements, Salesforce has built a powerful, yet easy to use Mobile SDK with a vibrant developer community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the upcoming launch of Mobile SDK 3.0, we have built a highly adaptable “Canonical Sample App,” designed to serve as the basis for a feature rich mobile app implementation. This sample app demonstrates the combination of various advanced features around Offline Data Synchronization of Salesforce objects. Developers can unlock a lot more potential by picking ideas or extending the app to suit their needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32581" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1416358566/polymer_apps2_k5xlyi.png" width="600" height="373" /></p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="375" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jzTNJsGIXGg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">For an instant preview, just sign-in with your Salesforce credentials to the Heroku hosted version of this app <a href="https://sfdc-sobject-editor.herokuapp.com">https://sfdc-sobject-editor.herokuapp.com</a></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Salesforce Mobile SDK + Web Components</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Salesforce Mobile SDK provides APIs and implementations of the most essential building blocks for creating mobile apps. Core functionality like user identity, security, API wrappers, offline storage and containerization of web apps are instantly available out of the box to every Salesforce developer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Web Components is a set of new browser standards which let web developers build reusable widgets (also called components) using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Polymer is a highly flexible and easy to use Javascript library that ships with hundreds of high quality web components, empowering web developers to create sophisticated mobile apps. To learn more about Polymer, check out the tutorial on <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">https://www.polymer-project.org/</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">To help Developers build apps with these technologies, we’ve created the Polymer Developer Pack for Salesforce, an open-source project that integrates Salesforce API &amp; Mobile SDK with the Web Component standards. Instead of writing boilerplate code to authenticate, to fetch and update data using REST APIs, or to render the most common UI elements from Salesforce, developers can now dramatically reduce code by using the components from the Polymer Developer Pack and unleash the power of web components connected to the Salesforce architecture.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img class="wp-image-32601 aligncenter" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/r_4/v1416360519/architecture_cjqonc.png" width="600" height="338" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>From “Hello, Word” to an Enterprise App</h3>
<p dir="ltr">With Polymer, sophisticated functionality can be encapsulated using Web Components. Here’s a brief list of few components that are provided as part of this Polymer developer pack.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Force-signin: Never write boilerplate code to authenticate user into salesforce. This web component automatically handles complete OAuth flow inside a web browser or in a Mobile SDK based app. Usage:</p>
<pre>&lt;force-signin consumerkey="key" callbackurl="url"&gt;&lt;/force-signin&gt;</pre>
<p dir="ltr">Force-sobject-collection: Fetching a list of records from a sobject is as simple as adding an HTML tag on a web page. No more learning REST APIs or using Javascript to get your data. Usage:</p>
<pre>&lt;force-sobject-collection sobject="Account" querytype="mru"&gt;&lt;/force-sobject-collection&gt;</pre>
<p dir="ltr">Force-sobject: Fetching a record detail and storing it offline in just one line of HTML. Usage:</p>
<pre>&lt;force-sobject sobject="Account" recordid="0010000000000AAA"&gt;&lt;/force-sobject&gt;</pre>
<p dir="ltr">And many more for storing data offline to rendering detail UI of a record. Evolving a simple Hello, World app is just a matter of assembling and customizing components. With data driven components for the most common Salesforce elements developers can quickly build a working application.</p>
<pre>&lt;force-signin consumerkey="key" callbackurl="url"&gt;&lt;/force-signin&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;force-ui-app id="force_app" &gt;</pre>
<pre>       &lt;force-ui-list id="force_ui_list" sobject="Account"&gt;&lt;/force-ui-list&gt;</pre>
<pre>       &lt;force-ui-detail flex id="force_ui_detail" sobject="Account" recordid="{{$.force_ui_list.selected}}"&gt;&lt;/force-ui-detail&gt;</pre>
<pre>&lt;/force-ui-app&gt;</pre>
<h3>Getting Started… Very Quickly</h3>
<p dir="ltr">For instant access to the Salesforce Mobile UI Elements, we&#8217;re hosting a slightly modified version of the Polymer Designer that includes the visual and data elements in the components section. Developers can login into Salesforce orgs: <a href="https://sfdc-designer.herokuapp.com/">https://sfdc-designer.herokuapp.com/</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s also simple to install the entire source code with the Salesforce elements on your machine, grab the code from our Github repository at<a href="https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs/mobile-ui-elements"> http://bit.ly/mobile-ui-elements</a> or run the following commands.</p>
<p dir="ltr">sudo npm install -g grunt-cli</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ git clone https://github.com/ForceDotComLabs/mobile-ui-elements.git</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ cd mobile-ui-elements</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ npm install</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ bower install</p>
<p dir="ltr">To build the project, execute:</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ grunt</p>
<p dir="ltr">To build the project for distribution, execute (all assets will be generated in dist directory):</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ grunt dist</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last few months have seen an incredible evolution in Salesforce1 Platform developer education. One part of that is <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead">Trailhead</a>, the self-service, self-paced online portal where literally anyone can go and learn more about the platform at their convenience. If you haven&#8217;t tried <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead">Trailhead</a> yet <strong>STOP READING RIGHT NOW AND GO TRY IT</strong>.  Then come back.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re back?  OK.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m also extremely excited about the four hands-on Salesforce workshops we debuted at Dreamforce. </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited about these Salesforce workshops because they&#8217;re designed in such a way that anyone can deliver them. That&#8217;s right &#8212; anyone. In fact, we designed this brand new content during the late summer, and then tested it in front of user groups and at Elevate training events, with the specific goal of having people from the community deliver it at <a href="http://www.dreamforce.com">Dreamforce</a>.  And boy did they ever! Every session was full, and we had great feedback from attendees, all of whom got hands-on with technology they hadn&#8217;t used before.</p>
<p><strong>Today, these hands-on workshops are ready for you &#8212; yes, YOU! &#8212; to deliver.</strong> Maybe you want to help your fellow user group attendees build their first custom app. Maybe you want to help your developer co-workers get their arms around what it&#8217;s like to work on the Salesforce1 Platform. Or maybe you want to help a group of experienced admin friends take the leap into writing triggers.</p>
<p><strong>And delivering these is easy.</strong>  Check out the links for each of the workshops.  There is the workshop itself, leader slides and a sample video you can watch to see how someone else taught it.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Introduction to Point-And-Click App Building </strong>Target audience: beginner admins who understand core apps like Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, but want to learn how to make their own custom apps. <a href="http://jr0cket.co.uk/salesforce-admin-workshop/">Workbook</a> | <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/secret/rSUPdA8nG1rdsF">Slides</a> | <a href="http://dreamforce.vidyard.com/watch/fRCVCcmgnV3Ua1xcEDhOJg">Sample Video</a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Introduction to Coding for Admins and Non-Coders </strong>Target audience: intermediate admins who want to take their Salesforce knowledge to the next level.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At Dreamforce 2014, we brought together 26 partners, over a hundred Salesforce staff, and THOUSANDS of developers for an Internet of Things zone that was bigger than many standalone IoT conferences. Attendees got hands on in 48 workshops run by our partners, checked out <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduinos</a> and <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pis</a> to make their own&#8230; &#8216;things&#8217;, and even shot hoops in the 2 Point Challenge, powered by <a href="http://2lemetry.com/">2lemetry</a>:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89801" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1415994171/Hoops_ad6uhv.jpg" width="720" height="480" /></p>
<p>Congratulations, by the way, to Brian from Peach New Media on winning one of the <a href="http://www.94fifty.com/">94Fifty</a> instrumented basketballs!</p>
<p>Our Salesforce staffers demonstrated key IoT concepts via fun demos, including 3D printing and a robot activated by closing an opportunity in the Sales Cloud:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89811" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_720/v1415994295/ShowNTell_u9rxzk.jpg" width="720" height="481" /></p>
<p>Each of the sponsoring partners explained to attendees how their technology integrated with Salesforce. <a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a> showed a connected house demo that, while it used a model house, was hooked up to a set of very neat prototyping boards:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89821" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1415994404/House_z23biw.jpg" width="720" height="480" /></p>
<p>Over 500 developers got hands on with IoT technology in the partner workshops. Here&#8217;s Kris Moyse of <a href="http://www.proximityinsight.com/">ProximityInsight</a> leading a workshop on integrating <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/">iBeacons</a> with a mobile app:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89831" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_720/v1415994532/Workshop_qqdtae.jpg" width="720" height="481" /></p>
<p>While <a href="https://twitter.com/ReidCarlberg">Reid</a> and I were the focal points of the Internet of Things zone, it was truly a team effort. Many, many thanks to the attendees, staff and our awesome partners who made the zone a stunning success!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89771" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_720/v1415993645/IotSponsors_hfikpm.png" width="720" height="405" /></p>

<p>Matt shared pieces of <a title="elaine" href="https://twitter.com/elaine_marino" target="_blank">Elaine Marino&#8217;s</a> <a title="df14" href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF14/" target="_blank">Dreamforce 2014</a> DevZone session, &#8220;<strong>Grow Developers. Grow Diversity</strong>.&#8221;, saying &#8220;I saw the most wonderful presentation in the community theater on Wed afternoon&#8230;&#8221; and recounting how Elaine shared her personal journey and then gave practical advice on how to make hiring practices more inclusive and increase diversity in our companies.</p>
<p>A key piece of Elaine&#8217;s advice is about job descriptions. Rather than saying vague (and intimidating) things like &#8220;<em>Develop web applications based on complex scientific and engineering algorithms</em>,&#8221; be very clear about what you really need a developer to know:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Disclaimer</h1>
<p><em>The following story is based on experiences compiled from several real-world engagements with Salesforce users. The names of characters and companies in this story have been changed to protect their true identities&#8211;but you know who you are.   <img src="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </em></p>
<h1><img class="alignright wp-image-31561" title="Salesforce anti-patterns and worst practices" alt="Salesforce anti-patterns and worst practices" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/c_scale,w_204/v1415745521/anti-pattern_utgzns.jpg" width="204" height="128" />It Begins …</h1>
<p>Mike&#8217;s company, XYZ, just purchased Salesforce licenses for all of their sales reps, and it&#8217;s his team&#8217;s job to manage the rollout of Salesforce as quickly as possible. Mike, Vijay, and Lydia all have years of experience managing and customizing XYZ&#8217;s on-premise CRM system. They quickly skim the Salesforce documentation, recognize most of the general application and database development/administration concepts they read about, and thus conclude that this transition to Salesforce will be straightforward without much training necessary.</p>
<h1>Customizing the Salesforce Schema</h1>
<p>Vijay has lots of experience with relational databases, so Mike asks Vijay to customize the Salesforce schema for XYZ&#8217;s needs. Vijay quickly learns that standard object customization (e.g., Accounts, Leads, Opportunities), custom object creation, object relationships, and data validation are a breeze to configure without writing any SQL thanks to the intuitive Salesforce Setup UI. In particular, Vijay falls in love with formula fields, and creates many of them to dynamically surface related child data in parent objects and vice versa, thinking such fields will make reports and queries easier to build later on because they won&#8217;t require users to join objects.</p>
<h1>Loading Large Amounts of Data</h1>
<p>XYZ&#8217;s on-premises CRM system has millions of Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, etc. that all need to migrate to Salesforce. Lydia&#8217;s on it&#8211;she takes a quick lesson on the Salesforce Data Loader and decides this is the right tool for the job after loading a few records into a Salesforce Developer Edition org. The plan, she decides, is to wait until just before the CRM system switchover to extract data from the on-premises database into CSV files, then configure the Data Loader to use the Bulk API in parallel mode to pump the data into Salesforce as quickly as possible. The team&#8217;s under pressure for time, so Lydia doesn&#8217;t give her bulk data loading strategy another thought, and moves on to her next task &#8230;</p>
<h1>Creating and Maintaining Local Database Backups</h1>
<p>Even though XYZ is fully committed to their cloud strategy, they still want to maintain a local copy of their CRM data. Lydia rushes to meet this requirement next. Considering this task is the opposite of the data load she just devised, Lydia does a tad bit more training with the Data Loader and decides that this tool will also work to query and extract data from Salesforce to local CSV files on a nightly basis. The easiest way to meet this requirement, she decides, is to do simple full refresh of the local database every night.</p>
<h1>Users and Feature Governance</h1>
<p>Mike, meanwhile, has been working on a plan for user provisioning, data access, and feature governance. Here, Mike learns that there are some unique Salesforce concepts and features to understand, including record ownership and strategies for sharing private records. Mike takes his time gathering requirements and implementing a role hierarchy and a number of sharing rules on Accounts, Cases and Opportunities to meet them. Because they want users to have the appropriate visibility right away, Lydia and Mike decide to make the objects Private and implement the sharing rules before loading the data. He also makes a note that the sharing rules will need to be recalculated for the org every quarter, first thing Monday morning after the new sales account assignments are available. [X]</p>
<p>Mike decides to enable users to help themselves whenever possible when it comes to certain Salesforce features. For example, creating Salesforce reports and dashboards are easy, so Mike decides to let sales reps create their own reports around their data access permissions. His reasoning: Why should he spend time researching requirements for reports and dashboards when users can build and maintain what they need themselves?</p>
<h1>Business Process Configuration</h1>
<p>Mike is also in charge of configuring various business processes for XYZ&#8217;s users. The first key requirement is to set up something that will drive workflow for Sales reps&#8211;what Leads to call next, in order of priority.</p>
<p>Mike meets with Jamie in Sales, an experienced Salesforce user from before her time at XYZ, to discuss this key requirement and others. Jamie recommends an easy solution&#8211;that each sales rep create their own list view for Leads, and refresh the list view periodically so that they always see the latest Leads requiring attention. Mike loves the idea because he doesn&#8217;t have to implement anything to meet the requirement. Sweet!</p>
<hr />
<h1>Sidebar: Anti-Patterns</h1>
<p>This fictitious, yet true to life, story demonstrates how some common anti-patterns emerge when implementing Salesforce. What&#8217;s an anti-pattern?</p>
<p>Design patterns in the context of computer science are proven, highly-effective approaches to solving common challenges in software development. So it makes sense that an anti-pattern is the opposite of a design pattern: A software implementation of some sort that is suboptimal.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go back to the story and learn more about the anti-patterns that adversely affect the Salesforce implementation and how the team can recover from these problems.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Fast Forward … Data Loads Fail</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s go time, ready to switch from on-premises to cloud. Lydia does a huge data dump from the on-premises CRM system, and transforms the data as necessary before attempting to load the data into Salesforce. She starts up the Data Loader and attempts to bulk load the data from the CSVs using the parallel loading feature.</p>
<p>Some of the initial loads go very quickly&#8211;for example, the load of the parent Account object. However, subsequent loads of some related objects are plagued with lock contention errors causing batch retries, leading to painfully slow loads that often result in load failures. Lydia is extremely frustrated and starts to wonder if Salesforce can handle their data requirements.</p>
<h2>Problem Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Lydia doesn&#8217;t understand the Salesforce locking mechanisms and how those can affect her bulk data load. If she did, she could easily work around this by pre-sorting the child records by parent Id in her CSV file to lessen the chance of parent record lock contention among parallel load batches. Lydia also doesn’t realize that the sharing configuration that she and Mike set up prior to the data load is further contributing to the poor loading performance which is then magnifying her lock contention problems. By deferring the org’s sharing calculations until after her data load, she could significantly increase both the load and sharing calculation performance.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Full Database Backups are Slow</h1>
<p>Lydia is now doubly frustrated. Why? The nightly full data backups that she configured using the Data Loader take a lot of time to complete and sometimes slow down other jobs&#8211;every night.</p>
<h2>Problem Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Lydia is attempting to refresh the entire local database every night, doing more work than what&#8217;s necessary. This translates into long-running Bulk API jobs that unnecessarily hold onto asynchronous processing threads and delay other batch work from happening.</p>
<p>Instead, Lydia should be doing nightly incremental data backups&#8211;only backing up the data that is new or updated since the previous incremental backup. When doing this, she should use queries that filter records using SystemModstamp (a standard field in all objects that has an index) rather than LastModifiedDate field (not indexed).</p>

</ul>
<h1>Users Complain About Slow Reports</h1>
<p>Mike&#8217;s decision to let sales reps create reports at will is coming back to haunt him. Every day, he gets complaints about reports that take a long time to complete, sometimes timing out and failing altogether. Salesforce Support is great at helping him diagnose the problems with each report as they come in, but it turns into nearly a full-time job to just manage the seemingly constant inflow of report problems.</p>
<p>As Mike works with more and more problem reports, patterns begin to emerge. Most reports are suffering from the same ailment&#8211;inefficient reports with non-selective filters on unindexed fields. Even worse, Mike sees that every sales rep is creating virtually identical poorly performing reports, so he&#8217;s repeating the same work over and over again to tune each sales rep&#8217;s reports.</p>
<h2>Problem Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Mike didn&#8217;t properly anticipate the problems with allowing everyone to create reports, nor did he educate XYZ&#8217;s users on how to build efficient reports that can scale as the company&#8217;s database grows. Additionally, Mike didn&#8217;t take the time to consider a great alternative&#8211;creating a library of public, controlled, and optimized reports that meet the requirements of XYZ&#8217;s sales reps. Fewer reports to tune and maintain, plus high user satisfaction.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Formula Fields Unknowingly Slow Reports</h1>
<p>Even after filter tuning, Mike observes that reports including many of those formula fields that Vijay built are still inefficient. How is this determined? Salesforce Support works through the cases with Mike and notes that such reports have five or more joins in the underlying query plan.</p>
<h2>Problem Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Report builders are including many of the formula fields that Vijay built to surface data from related records dynamically at report runtime. Consequently, Salesforce performs many joins in the underlying query to run the report.</p>
<p>Formula fields are a great tool when used in the proper context while understanding the scalability and response time implications for their usage. However, without proper understanding of how they function, formula fields can sometimes come back to bite you.</p>
<p>If Mike and Vijay had studied the formula fields more and understood that these formula fields had the potential to slow down many reports and queries, Vijay might have implemented the fields differently: For example, using a trigger to populate denormalized related fields that would facilitate blazing report/query performance without runtime joins.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Sharing Recalculations Clobber Nightly Backups</h1>
<p>The first sharing recalculation is due, so Mike kicks it off. Not only does the sharing recalculation take forever to complete, but Lydia calls Mike to explain that the nightly full backup also starts running slower than it already does. She has no idea why.</p>
<h2>Problem Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Sharing recalculations and Bulk API jobs both draw from the org&#8217;s available pool of asynchronous processing threads. This competition causes both jobs to go slower than if they were scheduled to happen apart from one another. Also, if the full backup was changed to a much faster incremental backup, the time requirement for the backup (and thread usage) would be much smaller, allowing more time for the sharing recalculation.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Sales Reps Develop Productivity (and Eyesight) Issues</h1>
<p>Refreshing reports constantly for hot, open Leads was easy to implement, but not well thought out in terms of user productivity. Each refresh forces a sales rep to scan the entire list of Leads again and again to pick targets that are new or changed since the most recent refresh.</p>
<h2>Problem Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Mike took the seemingly easy solution and didn&#8217;t consider the productivity of the end user when choosing the approach to implement. With a more thorough analysis, Mike would have seen that Salesforce has many easy-to-implement workflow solutions such as workflow rules for this type of process.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Mike, Vijay, and Lydia thought they were making the proper decisions when implementing Salesforce for XYZ. An overarching reason that they experienced so many problems is because, based on their experience working with on-premise systems, they made assumptions that led to Salesforce performance issues later. They could have considered how one part of the implementation might affect others and tested their design for scalability under planned workloads before going live into production. Lesson learned: A little time planning and testing upfront can save a lot of time addressing the technical debt afterward.</p>
<p>The good news is that the links to the related information in each anti-pattern section provide solutions that the team read and implemented. Now XYZ&#8217;s implementation performs and scales well, and sales reps are super productive and closing lots of new deals with the new workflow solution.</p>

<p>A few months ago, there was an announcement that went out to all employees about a Salesforce labs competition. The challenge was to build a mobile app, pass a security review, create a YouTube video to market it, and list it on AppExchange. This sounded like a great opportunity since I’d always wanted to build an app on the Salesforce platform, but I didn’t know how to start. What would I build? Did I have all the skills needed? Did I have the time? Should I ask someone for help? All these questions confounded me. Then a thought struck – maybe I could find fellow developers who had the skills I lacked.</p>
<p>I’ve worked on various teams within Salesforce over my 8 years here: applications, platforms, core services and most recently on Chatter. These varied areas have given me a good understanding of org administration, custom objects, Apex code, connect rest API and the Chatter feed. However, I did not have much experience with Visualforce. I had built a few pages, but didn’t know how to integrate these with my own custom JavaScript code.</p>
<p>So I made a post on an internal Chatter group asking for help. Crickets. I registered myself for the competition anyway, hoping I would find a team later. A couple of weeks later, a developer on another team, Mark, made a post looking for team members. I hadn’t met Mark before and asked him if he knew Visualforce. He said he knew enough to be dangerous, which was exactly what I was looking for! Soon after, Kate, our office manager, and Erin, a doc writer on another team, also replied and asked if they could join. And there you have it, our little team of 4 was born. We needed a name, so clearly, “Best Team Ever” was suiting.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-31721" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1415912012/SF_Image1_wrfpec.png" width="1282" height="460" /></p>
<p>Since we were all based in Seattle, we met weekly to brainstorm on our project. Coming up with the actual idea was hard! Erin did a detailed analysis about ideas posted and voted on in <a href="https://success.salesforce.com/ideaSearch">IdeaExchange</a> to help us select, reject, and shortlist ideas. Kate evaluated various existing apps to help us understand where we were headed. Shortly after, it came to us. We wanted to build a mobile app that lets you upload images into an album and share it on Chatter [insert applause here]. We called it <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B5Y6WEAV">Magpie</a> after a bird that likes to collect shiny objects. The name was Kate’s creative genius!</p>
<p>Erin and Kate were the creative brains on our team and helped solidify the requirements, build wireframes, create the video script, etc. Mark helped us leap forward by evaluating different public libraries and employing his awesome development skills to create various prototypes. He not only built all the initial code, but also built the tools needed to deploy quickly to an organization. I was new to using a git repository, but Mark helped me get ramped up quickly. I also worked with the Chatter Connect API to build some key pieces.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-31731" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1415912003/SF_Image2_ifgdqe.png" width="300" height="300" />We decided to each put in at most 2 hours per week since this project was in addition to our regular work. As the deadlines approached, we had to break this rule and work some late nights of course!</p>
<p>We used libraries such as <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> to build our models, views and templates, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for some of our CSS styling. Pushing code into a git repository helped Mark and I work together effectively. We spoke often to avoid duplication of work and stomping on each other’s code changes. We didn’t have too many conflicts since Mark worked late at night and I (mom of a toddler) preferred waking up to work in the wee hours of the morning. After a few days, we were mostly done with the code.</p>
<p>Kate worked hard and sent us some beautiful app icons that made it complete and ready for security review. We passed the review and soon after, it was time to create the video and appexchange listing. Erin created the script for the video and Kate recorded the voiceover (we think she has a new calling!). I used Kate’s voiceover to create the video presentation and soon after it was public on the AppExchange. All in all, building my first app was hard work but the results were amazing and a lot of fun! Frankly, I did not think we would get that far in just three months. Most recently, we were also able to present Magpie at Dreamforce on the Demopalooza stage in costume.</p>
<p>In short, we finally have an app on the Salesforce AppExchange, which would not have been possible without my amazing team. Here are a few insights:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-31801" alt="" src="http://res.cloudinary.com/hzxejch6p/image/upload/v1415914696/SF_Image3_copy_ipbxzt.png" width="1282" height="382" />So my biggest takeaway? <b>If you cannot do it alone, then don’t. Form a team.</b></p>
<p>Do us a favor and check out <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/listingDetail?listingId=a0N3000000B5Y6WEAV">Magpie</a>!! We’d love your feedback so we can continue to improve it in the future!</p>
